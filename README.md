Introduction to the Pre-Release Build

This repository contains R code that implements graph-theoretic and information-theoretic analyses of the morphological voice networks of several languages. The core theoretical foundations of this analysis is based on the analyses carried out by Sims & Parker (2019) and Sims (2020), in which inflection class systems are conceptualized as networks with the distinct (micro-)classes as nodes connected by edges which represent the inter-class analogical potential of shared exponents. "Conceptualized thusly, the distribution of exponents across classes more generally √ê can be quantified in terms of network properties." (Sims & Parker 2019)

First and foremost, the R code in this release implements network visualizations and a range of standard graph-theoretic calculations over inflection class networks: degree, edge weight, clustering coefficient, connected components, shortest path length, betweenness centrality, modules, node role. Mostly the calculations are for individual networks, but the code implements some minimal comparison based on global clustering coefficient and mean shortest path length, comparing the individual networks to each other, and also to randomized versions of the same class systems (based on Monte Carlo simulations).

Additionally, the code implements probability and entropy calculations for individual paradigm cells, and mean values for the inflectional system as a whole. Conditional entropy is calculated pairwise over individual cells in the style of Ackerman et al. (2009, Parts and wholes: Implicative patterns in inflectional paradigms) and Ackerman and Malouf (2013, Morphological organization: The Low Conditional Entropy Conjecture). 

Finally, it calculates "entropy difference" -- the amount of average conditional entropy in a network minus the amount of average conditional entropy with one node (class) removed -- and graphs correlations between network properties and entropy difference, to facilitate evaluation of how network properties contribute to the 'complexity' of the inflection class system.

Ultimately, the scripts in this release are designed to facilitate quantitative, cross-linguistic comparison of inflectional systems based on their systemic internal organization.
