Methodological prelude

I adopt a lexical typological approach to voice morphology. The essential building blocks of such a typology are the argument structures of individual verbs (à la Levin 1993, Nichols et al. 2004), rather than the macrotypes of alignment patterns which characterize entire languages in morphosyntactic typology.

Rather than attempting to establish a general coding pattern for any of the langauges under investigation (with or without a threshold percentage of verbs exhibiting a certain coding pattern for Subjects and Objects), this project, like other projects in lexical typology, seeks 'to determine the kinds and frequencies of all coding patterns and not just the typical ones.' (Nichols 2008)
